      <p>
        Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
        other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
        <br /><br />
        What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
        knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy
        and freedom. <br /><br />But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer!
        And it’s simple: An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring
        distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated
        scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption. <br /><br />Put even
        simpler <b>— it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</b>
